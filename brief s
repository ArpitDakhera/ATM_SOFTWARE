We got a project on ATM process. Here is some intro of our project.

Introduction

Purpose:
This document describes the software requirements and specification (SRS) for an
automated tellermachine (ATM) network. The document is intended for the customer and 
the developer (designers, testers, maintainers).
The reader is assumed to have basic knowledge of banking accounts and account
services. Knowledge
and understanding of Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams is also
required.

Scope:

The network enables customers to complete simple bank account services via automated teller machines
(ATMs) that maybe located off premise and that need not be owned and operated by the
customers bank. The ATM identifies a customer by a cash card and password. It collects
information about a simple account transaction (e.g., deposit, withdrawal, transfer, bill 
 payment), communicates the transaction information to the customers bank, and dispenses
cash to the customer. The banks provide their own software for their own computers.
